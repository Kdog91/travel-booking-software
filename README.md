## Reflection on Essential Questions

### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is a fundamental aspect of software development. By gathering requirements, analyzing use cases, and engaging in discussions with stakeholders, I ensure that the program meets its intended purpose. Creating user stories helps in this process by breaking down user requirements into smaller, manageable tasks that align with business goals. User stories provide a clear vision of what the end user expects, allowing for iterative development and continuous feedback.

### How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach program development with a structured, iterative mindset, leveraging Agile methodologies to ensure flexibility and responsiveness to change. The Agile processes I hope to incorporate in my future work include Sprint Planning, Daily Standups, Sprint Reviews, and Retrospectives. These practices promote collaboration, transparency, and incremental improvements, ensuring that software development remains aligned with user needs and business objectives.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively participating in discussions, collaborating with colleagues, and contributing to the project’s success. It involves effective communication, being receptive to feedback, and supporting teammates in problem-solving. Additionally, embracing Agile values such as adaptability, continuous learning, and delivering value to the user ensures a strong team dynamic and successful software development outcomes.
